        <h1 id="Article-Title">Blocking advertisements on your mobile phone</h1>
            <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Ads are everywhere on modern day devices, especially on your mobile phone but did you know that you can easily block ads on your mobile phone and other internet enabled devices such as tablets and smart TVs for free.</p>
                <p>You can use an alternative DNS server to block ads, this works by preventing your device from connecting to the malicious servers that deliver you annoying ads on your device.</p>
                <p>Ads are annoying, they put you at risk from malware, scams, and can even alter your political views, therefore you should block them from your device.</p>
            <h2 id="NextDNS">NextDNS</h2> 
            <p>The NextDNS, DNS provider is my preferred DNS provider as it is free to use if you have less than 300,000 requests a month, if you exceed this limit the service will disable automatically and automatically resume at the start of the next month, therefore you don't need to pay anything to use this service.</p>
            <p>The NextDNS service is really easy to setup and there is also a paid plan that will give you an unlimited number of requests.</p>
            <a class="linkbutton" title="Visit the NextDNS website" href="https://nextdns.io/">NextDNS official website</a>
            <h2 id="setting-up-NextDNS">Setting up NextDNS</h2>
                <p>It is really easy to setup the NextDNS service, you just need to make a free account and change a few settings to ensure that the ads will be blocked on your device.</p>

                    <p>NextDNS does not come with the optimal settings by default, therefore you will need to configure NextDNS so that it works well for your particular needs.</p>
                    <p>The first thing that you need to do is click on the settings button, this will allow you to configure the NextDNS service.</p>
                    <img src="dns_adblocker/nextDNS_enable_logs.PNG" alt="enable logs is deactivated.">
                    <p>On the settings page you will see an option to "Enable Logs", you want to deactivate this so that it looks like the image above, this prevents NextDNS from keeping a record of your internet browsing activities.</p>
